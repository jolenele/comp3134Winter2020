To improve the security of the directory_traversal_part1.php file, I use basename() to clarify that the base folder to scan is /var/www/html,
code:
$allowedDirectory = 'var/www/html';
$path = isset(GET['q']) ? basename($allowedDirectory) : '.'

- I also check if file exists and keep attacker at wherever place they are and hide the error
if(!file_exists($path)){
error_reporting(0);
}
